# Swift on Armv7
The Swift on Armv7 project has been set up to provide the community with easy access to a powerful 32-bit build environment.  
It is hoped that this will provide the tools needed to achieve an up to date Swift toolchain for 32-bit Debian/Ubuntu distributions.

We will be starting with Swift 5.6.1 release version on Debian 11 Bullseye.
